%%%%  ABSTRACT
\chapter*{\center Abstract}

The aim of the project is to create an application which enables ASDA colleagues to identify
and inform colleagues of which items within their fresh departments are going out of date and
need to be marked down or could potentially be provided to food shelters. The technology that
will be utilised in this project will make use of mobile technology, backend web services and 
Database stored procedures in order to analyse and inform colleagues which items are likely to go 
out of date on which date and then informs colleagues to go and reduce the products. This application
will be used throughout ASDA stores by colleagues on a daily basis and could produce a significant
cost saving and waste reduction.
\\
\\
The final products of this project will be a system of applications which will be ready for deployment
into an ASDA store in the future. The requirements and periodic demoing of the produced solution will
be provided by ASDA technology colleagues.

%%%%  INTRODUCTION

\chapter{Project Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

\section{Scope}

\subsection{ASDA}


\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}

The aim of this project is to design an application and stock management system which is able
to inform store managers and store colleagues on which items of stock are going out of date or
close to going out of date on the shop floor. This stock will then either be marked 
down on the shop floor in order to be sold on the day or will be identified as able to be donated to other charitable
causes within the local community as part of the ASDA commitment to engage and assist in the local community.
\\
\\
The key goals of the developed system are to include:
\\
- An application which will direct colleagues to which items need to be marked down.
\\
- The hours spent in store manually marking down products will be reduced.
\\
- Stock which is wasted will be reduced and identified for redistribution.
\\
\\
These goals will be assessed by peer review of colleagues in ASDA. I am also aiming to 
deploy the application in a live ASDA store with the aim of it being used in a live environment.
If I am able to deploy a POC into a live store then I will also assess the success of the 
application by comparing the product waste prior to usage in store against the wastage from 
the time that the application is used in store. 

\subsection{Potential Expansion}
\subsubsection{Timesheeting}
Through the use of data mining from the data collected by the application, we should be able to accurately predict
how long it takes staff to organise and mark down the expiring items within their respective departments. Once 
this data has been collected then theoretically it could be used in order to calculate how many staff are needed 
in order to mark down items on a particular day depending on the number of items that need to be reduced as well 
as the length of time that it is likely to take the staff in order to mark down or redistribute the expiring stock
on the shop floor. 

\subsubsection{Stock Prediction and Inventory Management}

By analysing the number of items which are expiring in individual stores we should also be able to perform trend 
analysis on the data which should highlight items of stock which are repeatedly marked down. This trend analysis 
could then be used to inform store managers and the ASDA inventory management systems of any over ordering which is 
occuring and allow for more accurate stock levels to reduce potential waste in the future.

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Project Methodology}
The methodology that I have chosen to implement this project in is a scrum agile methodology which involves short 
iterations of development spread over the 8 weeks I will be developing my solution in. 
This will include the breaking down of the application development into smaller development tasks which can be completed easily. 
\\
\\
Scrum involves the sizing, estimation and development of the development tasks prior to development. Once completed
the developed features will be demoed to the project supervisors and stakeholders in order to gain feedback which 
can potentially be added to the project backlog and acted on in following sprints.
\\
The project will include the management and development of multiple application features. Each of the features will 
be detailed and documented on a kanban board (See Figure~\ref{fig:kanbanBoard}) which will be managed via the Trello 
application.  As can be seen in Figure 1 the kanban board is broken down into "To Do", "Doing" and "Done" swim lanes 
which allows the user to easily identify the state of the feature that is being developed.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./assets/images/Kanban-board.png}
    \caption{Xpire Kanban Board}
    \label{fig:kanbanBoard}
\end{figure}

Scrum typically consists of 5 different types of meetings: the stand up, the planning, the Retro and the refinement 
session. All of these sessions are performed once throughout the sprint in order to plan, agree and highlight any 
issues that the development team might be having throughout the week.

%%%%  DESIGN

\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}
This chapter covers the planned design of the Xpire system. At the moment all of the plans
for the application are theoretical and could potentially change however I believe that
this is a sensible approach which should be suitable for the proposed system.

\section{Architectural Diagram}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./assets/images/architecture_diagram.png}
    \caption{Xpire Architecture Diagram}
    \label{fig:architecture-diagram}
\end{figure}

As shown in the architecture diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture-diagram})
- The Application will be usable via 3 methods:
\\
\\
- An android application which is available on in store handsets called TC70, TC70X or TC72. These devices are available to all colleagues who work within ASDA stores and are frequently used for other applications within the store ecosystem.
\\
\\
- An android and iOS application which will be downloadable and usable from store colleagues personal devices via an internal application management system.
\\
\\
- A web browser which is accessible from a managers workbench or a colleague laptop. This will give colleagues an alternative view of the application due to the fact that the application is not being accessed via a mobile device.

\subsection{Application Breakdown}
As shown in the architectural diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture-diagram} the application will consist of three separate applications and two databases.
 Below are the descriptions and breakdowns of the applications:

\subsubsection{Mobile Application}
The mobile versions of the application will be written using React-Native which is a modern mobile development
 framework created and maintained by Facebook. The reason for choosing React Native is because it is a well known and well documented framework with a large and active user community. It is also the recommended mobile development framework for ASDA and Wal-Mart. 

\subsubsection{Web Application}
The web application will be written using React which is very similar to React-native and has also been widely adopted. There are plenty of libraries for React and it is the chosen development framework because I am already familiar with the React ecosystem. 

\subsubsection{Backend Web Services}
The web services of the system are going to be developed using Java Spring Boot which ensures that the services will be enterprise worthy. The services will be hosted within a docker image and will be able to be span up on either Azure application servers or Azure Kubernetes clusters. The web services will be written using the repository design pattern\cite{gamma1994design} for interacting with the databases. All services will be thoroughly unit tested. The web services will be documented using Swagger so that users and future developers are easily able to pick up and alter the code base. 

\subsubsection{Azure SQL Databases}
SQL data which will be encrypted in transit and at rest manually. This database will contain the item data which is discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:data} below. At the moment I am unsure as to if I will store images of the individual items within BLOB storage. If I do decide to store item images then the SQL database will also store the references to the relevant item images.

\subsubsection{Azure Cosmos Database}
I have chosen to use Azure Cosmos DB for logging data due to the speed that items can be both written and retrieved from the data stores. Azure Cosmos DB is the Azure non relational database offering with encryption both in transit and at rest.

\subsubsection{Authentication \& Authorisation}
SingleSignOn is the authentication method which I have chosen to adopt for all of my applications. This allows the applications to integrate well within the ASDA technology stack and ensures that colleagues will be able to authenticate with their normal credentials. This removes the need for colleagues to need to remember new credentials or to have to have other accounts created in order to use the Xpire application. 

\subsection{Interaction Chart}
The Interaction Chart (see Fig~\ref{fig:eventTrace}) below highlights how a user interacts with the planned application. Figure ~\ref{fig:eventTrace} details the processes that are involved in one simple use case of the application in order to complete the scanning and checking of product details and expiry dates with a mobile device.
The event trace details how a colleague will scan the barcode of an item  in order to query the DB for item information and expiration date. Using the information provided the employee will then be able to reduce the item on the shop floor.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./assets/images/eventTrace-itemscan.png}
    \caption{Mobile Event Trace}
    \label{fig:eventTrace}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Data}\label{chap:data}
\section{Data used in the system}
The data used in the system will be item based information which will include a unique identifier
for an item, the expiry date / use by date of the item, the product name, the producer of the item, 
the store quantity of an item and an image of the item. 
All of this data will be available from internal ASDA databases. 
\\
\\
Other data which the application will make use of are the request details of requests 
within the system. This data is collected for the purpose of troubleshooting and monitoring
and alerting of potential issues within the application. The data will include, Request Type,
Request Content, Timestamp, Response Content, Response Information and Request Origin.
   
   
\section{Ethical Use of Data}
The data that is gathered in my application is not human related data.
The application only deals with the gathering of information on items and stores.
No user identifiable data is used therefore I have agreed with my supervisor that
there is no need to need to complete the Ethical Approval Form.
\\
\\
The only human data that will be used within this project is the feedback and opinions
of employees for ASDA which will be used in order to assess wether the goals of the 
project have been met. The consent of those whose feedback I will be using will be 
collected as and when it is required and Each individual will complete a consent form
prior to their opinions being included in the final report.

\chapter{Plan}\label{chap:plan}
The main milestones of my project are outlined in the Gannt Chart in Appendix~\ref{app:ganntchart}. 

The main milestones identified are: 
\subsubsection{Research}
I have so far completed this section of the priject which involved research into the background of my project as well as looking into previous solutions that have been developed which offer similar functionality to the system I intend to produce.
\subsubsection{Synopsis}
This section will be complete with the production of this document which details what the project aims are and an initial plan of how I will complete my aims.
\subsubsection{Design}
The design phase of the project is going to focus on the production of user interfaces for the various applications within the system.
\subsubsection{Development Sprints}
The development section is the longest continuous section of the project which I plan on splitting into eight, one week iterations which will include planning, development and demoing of individual features. This has been dicussed further in chapter~\ref{chap:intro}.
\subsubsection{Testing}
As part of the agile methodology I will be testing my code as I write it in each iteration.
\subsubsection{Demo / Deployment}
I have included a main milestone which is the final demo of the complete working system to the project stakeholders in order to gain final feedback which will be used to assess wether the project has completed its main aims. 
\subsubsection{Write up}
The write up of the project documentation is the longest individual section of my project as I aim to write up the documentation as I work through the project. 
\subsubsection{Dissertation proof read and finalisation}
The final stage of the project includes the proof reading of my final report and final adjustments prior to submission.
